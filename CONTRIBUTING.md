# How to Contribute

The recommended way to contribute to this repository - this may deviate from the recommended way to contribute to repositories in general:

1. Fork the repo
2. Branch your fork - give it a name that represents what is is, for example:
    - `solution/challenge-1`
    - `solution/factor-finder`
    - `fix/readme-typo`
    - `add/factor-finder-tests`
    - `improve/challenge-1-efficiency`
3. Once you're happy with your changes, take the forked branch and make a pull request against this repo
4. You wait for my response - there is nothing you can do now, I'll respond in a timely mannor.

> As you probably noticed, I tend to use verbs as my grouping tokens in branchnames, so as long as it's a verb that makes sense with the topic matter it should be fine.

> Even if it's not though, I'm not a stickler for the small details and I'll probably merge it anyway.
